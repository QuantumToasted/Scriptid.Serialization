# Scriptid.Serialization
A serializer for transforming [Scriptid](https://github.com/QuantumToasted/Scriptid) code into abstract syntax trees.

This project was based on and inspired greatly by another project, [Î»anguage](http://lisperator.net/pltut/parser/), which accomplishes nearly the same thing, albeit in JavaScript.
